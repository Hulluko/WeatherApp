# WeatherApp
The app gets weather info by API from OpenWeatherMap.

When you run the app, its looks like this:
![Start](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a14a4815-b1f9-4071-8f1b-e89bbad81b8a)

You then search a city by name and press enter:
![Search](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8660c9a-b113-4e06-9443-1eb67358f1fa)

The app shows the current day weather and 5-day forecast for the city:
![City](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9e06a04-fd4c-481b-80f6-327dd812df3f)

If the city name is not valid, you get an error message:
![Error](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aed5604e-21e3-4002-b43c-6bde348c1940)

The use for the app is to search and see weather info on any city in the world
